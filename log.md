# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 3, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Technoobys project. Built out a footer for the website and added the functionality to only get posts that have been published

**Thoughts:** I think it went well. I still have a ton of work to do on this website. My next focus is to begin building a home/landing page that is more appealing and describes better what technoobys is about.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
